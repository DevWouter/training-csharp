# Rules

notes: The rules are designed to make sure that we can all learn together in the most optimal way.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Rules

1. Safe environment
2. Questions? Feedback? Always!
3. Avoid working ahead
3. No outside help  
   (AI, StackOverflow, Google, coworker, etc.)

notes: 
1. In order to improve ourselves, we need to be able to doubt ourselves and our ideas. This is hard to do if we are afraid of being judged.
2. Asking can be at any time, answering may be delayed.
3. Working ahead will make it harder for you to understand the material.
4. The material is designed to be self-contained. If you use outside help, we as trainer failed or you are doing something else then what we intended.
