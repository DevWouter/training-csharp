## What does a computer do?

A computer ...
- takes input,
- processes it, 
- and gives output

## Early mechanical computers

Gears and levers, no electricity

## Early vaccuum tubes computers

notes:
- The blue thing is a vaccuum tube and can hold a charge
- The black things are integrated circuits

## Early integrated circuit and microprocessors

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/C01/vishnu-mohanan-yQpAaMsQzYE-unsplash.jpg" -->

notes:
- started to look like desktop computers
- IC: amplification, filtering, decode audio, etc.
- Microprocessor: Many ICs on a single chip
- Finally hardware that can be changed by software

## Software
* Programming is the process of writing instructions for a computer to follow.
* A program is a set of instructions for a computer to follow.
* Code is the instructions that make up a program.

## TL;DR

* Early computers could only chang behavior by changing hardware
* Modern computers can also change behavior by changing software
