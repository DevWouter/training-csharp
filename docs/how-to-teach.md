# How to teach

If you are using this repository to teach C# then this file might contain a few more tips for you.

## Setting goals

1. Safe environment is always priority one. Learning is all about excepting mistakes/shortcomings and learning/improving from them. People should feel safe.
2. Be aware that your goal is to **TEACH** C#, not give a talk about C#. The goal in teaching is to ensure the trainees/students understand the concepts and can apply them. The goal in giving a talk is to impress the audience with your knowledge. The two are not the same.
   1. Interact with the group
   2. Switch styles of teaching
3. Time management
   1. You can't spend forever on a single lesson. You have to move on.
   2. You can't spend forever on a single student. You have to move on.
4. Be aware that you are not the only teacher. The students will learn from each other. You are just the facilitator.
5. Failing will happen 
   1. You will get stuck 
   2. A student will get stuck
   3. A computer will get stuck/crash/freeze (tip: always have notes and whiteboard to draw upon)
   4. The power will go out (tip: always keep your laptop charged
6. Work from the fundamentals up. Every lesson should build on the previous lessons. 
   1. If you skip a lesson then the students will not understand the next lesson.
   2. Some exercises are more about repeating the previous lessons than learning new concepts.
   3. Spend a lot of time on the first few lessons. The first few lessons are the most important.
7. Don't be afraid to repeat yourself. If you have to repeat yourself 10 times then do it. If you have to repeat yourself 100 times then do it. If you have to repeat yourself 1000 times then do it. The students will not understand the concepts until they have heard it 1000 times. If you don't repeat yourself then the students will not understand the concepts.<br>And I you wonder why I kept increasing the number, that is because you still don't repeat it enough.
8. Always ask for feedback
   1. At the beginning and end of the lesson
   2. But don't always act on feedback. Sometimes the feedback is wrong (or your approach to address feedback).

## Teaching styles

- Story telling: "A long time ago in a galaxy far far away..."
  - Most people remember narrative stories
  - Example: "My first application was a tool that would be used to scan emails to look for product code since head office always send lengthy emails and that code was never in the same place twice."
- Demonstration
  - Showing is more powerful than telling especially when people doubt it
  - Example: Writing an application using notepad and then compile it using the command line (csc.exe)
- Experience
  - Same as demonstration but this then letting the students try it out
- Experimentation
  - What if we do this? What if we do that?
  - Example: "So if I change this in the code, the following will happen"
- Explanation
  - The most common teaching style (and the weakest)
  - Example: "This is what a struct is \*points to the struct in the slide\*"
  - Note: Most of the examples use this style in the comments, so skip it when demonstrating since the students can read it for them selves.
- Question and answer
  - Ask them a question and let them answer it
  - Warning: Dangerous since people might mean differnt things when they answer. We might hear the correct answer, but they might mean something else that is wrong.
  - Example: "What is the difference between a struct and a class?"
- Discussion
  - Open ended questions, can be combined with problem solving
  - Example: "What is the best appraoch to solve this problem?"
- Debate
  - Same as discussion but let the students argue their points and only let them move on when they have reached a conclusion and covered all points.
  - Warning: Takes a lot of time and requires healthy communication skills from all parties.
  - Example: "Can you tell me why a class is a better choice than a struct?"
- Role play
  - Pick a student (or students) and tell them their role
  - Example: "Lets assume that you are the customer. What information does your loyalty card hold and what should I store in the database?"
- Exercises
  - Give them a problem to solve
  - Warning: This is not the same as a test. A test is a way to measure the students understanding of the material. An exercise is a way to practice the material.
  - Tip: I alway enjoy a morning exercise. I put 5 very simple tasks on the screen of increasing difficulty. I tell them that I expect them to solve the first one, but not the last one. Then they have 15~30 minutes to solve them.
  - Example: "Write a program that will calculate the average of 3 numbers"
- Games
  - Same as exercises but people can "win" in games.
  - Example: "You get bronze if you solve the first 3 exercises, silver if you solve the first 5 and gold if you solve all 10"
- Homework
  - Give them a problem to solve at home
  - Warning: This only works if you can check the homework and provide feedback. No opportunity for feedback? Then it's waste of time for both.
- Tests
  - Give them a test to measure their understanding of the material.
  - Example: "Write a program that will calculate the average of 3 numbers"

## Learning styles

People have a **preference** but they use all of them.

- Visual (pictures, diagrams, graphs, etc)
- Audio (listening)
- Reading & Writing
- Kinesthetic (touching, moving, etc)

This can be done in various forms:
- Social/Solitary
  - Social: "Let's do this together" (useful for extroverts)
  - Solitary: "Let's do this alone" (useful for introverts)
- Experimental vs Theoretical
  - Experimental: "What does this button? Let's press it"
  - Theoretical: "What does this button do? Let's read the manual"

The best way to teach is to use a combination of all of them.

## Teaching a failing individual in a group

- Q: A common issue is that you have a group of people and one of them is struggling. You can't spend all your time on that one person. So what do you do?
- A: First put the group to work on an exercise. This will keep them busy and they will learn from each other. Then focus on the students that are struggeling.

- Q: What if the student doesn't seem to listen to you? The student hears you, but nothing stays.
- A: Change your communication style. First listen to the speech pattern of the student, then match them. Some are in sugar-rush others sound like Spock (from Star Trek). By matching their style you try to match their thinking process.

## Final tips

- Every teacher has their own style. And you will most likely copy the style of your previous teachers. That's fine. But don't be afraid to try new things. You might find something that works better for you.
- People can only study for 3 hours straight, after that they need a long break. So 3 hours in the morning, a 1 hour break and then 3 hours in the afternoon.
- If you are teaching a group of people that are not all the same level, then you need to split them into groups. The groups should be of similar level. If you don't then the students will get bored and the slower students will get left behind.
  - Can't split them? Then you need to teach them at different speeds.
